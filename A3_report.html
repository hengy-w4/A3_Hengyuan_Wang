				Insights about the data/visualization:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Expressiveness and effectiveness of visual encodings: I think that the visualization is expressive in terms of its use of channels and encodings. The designer chose to encode the temporal information by a combination of angle and length (of radius), the goal of which I comprehend was to create an effect that time is “flowing” and that the extent of the event (pandemic) is “growing”. Overall, the shape of the visualization resembles that of a vortex, and I appreciate this specific choice because as someone caught off-guard by the pandemic, it did feel like I had been trapped in the middle of a sunken vortex. However, I would argue that the effectiveness of this design is compromised for the emphasis on expressiveness: for one thing, the 7-day average of new Covid-19 cases is encoded by area/width of the band, whose resolution is relatively coarse since 0-150K cases are represented with a modest increase in width. For another, since the temporal code is represented by both the angle and length, it is a bit more difficult to compare the widths especially when they are placed in an angled position. Another limitation in the design’s effectiveness is that the design is visually imbalanced: the distribution of encoded areas feels denser towards upper and lower left portions of the visualization. Albeit this is the result of the actual data, this specific design sort of puts these details to highlight, and to me as an audience, it presents a predicate of tendency to focus on the thicker portions, which, as I will explain next, serves the purpose of expression.</li>
				<li>Data delivery and clarity: The designer clearly had “hidden” some features of the data. The message of this visualization, I presume, is to showcase the waves of COVID-19 pandemics by the dynamics of incidence rate. While the spiral form may successfully communicate a sense of cyclical recurrence and temporal progression, it sacrifices clarity for aesthetic and metaphorical effect. Important numerical information—such as exact case counts, relative peak severity, and rate of decline—is not immediately legible. I must spend additional cognitive effort to decode the scale and orientation before extracting substantive insights. In this sense, the data are not entirely invisible, but they are partially obscured by design choices that prioritize narrative and visual impact over straightforward readability. This prioritization, however, is not necessarily a negative feature, instead, it does improve the delivery. The trend that COVID-19 cases in the United States occurred in recurring waves across 2020, 2021, and 2022 is visually clear. The spiral structure reinforces the cyclical passage of time, and the expanding radius effectively communicates the increasing magnitude of successive surges. Even without carefully reading the numeric scale, I could grasp that later waves, particularly in 2021 and early 2022, were substantially larger than those in 2020.</li>
				<li>Labeling, spacing, and design styling: Overall, the spacing and layout are thoughtfully constructed. The spiral composition creates a strong visual flow, guiding the eye naturally from 2020 at the center outward to 2022. There is sufficient white space around the spiral to prevent crowding, and the radial month markers are lightly styled so they do not compete with the primary data. The color choice helps subtly signaling urgency or danger (red). Although we have had debates in labs and lectures about how color choices could modify the audiences’ focus and interpretation, in this case I think the design language is relatively restrictive (as opposed to the Iraq war visualization oversaturated, vibrant blood-colored red we’ve seen in reading group), which indicates that the designers are trying to maintain a sense of neutrality in their delivery.</li>

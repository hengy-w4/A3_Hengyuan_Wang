				Insights about the data/visualization:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Expressiveness and effectiveness of visual encodings: I think that the visualization is expressive in terms of its use of channels and encodings. The designer chose to encode the temporal information by a combination of angle and length (of radius), the goal of which I comprehend was to create an effect that time is “flowing” and that the extent of the event (pandemic) is “growing”. Overall, the shape of the visualization resembles that of a vortex, and I appreciate this specific choice because as someone caught off-guard by the pandemic, it did feel like I had been trapped in the middle of a sunken vortex. However, I would argue that the effectiveness of this design is compromised for the emphasis on expressiveness: for one thing, the 7-day average of new Covid-19 cases is encoded by area/width of the band, whose resolution is relatively coarse since 0-150K cases are represented with a modest increase in width. For another, since the temporal code is represented by both the angle and length, it is a bit more difficult to compare the widths especially when they are placed in an angled position. Another limitation in the design’s effectiveness is that the design is visually imbalanced: the distribution of encoded areas feels denser towards upper and lower left portions of the visualization. Albeit this is the result of the actual data, this specific design sort of puts these details to highlight, and to me as an audience, it presents a predicate of tendency to focus on the thicker portions, which, as I will explain next, serves the purpose of expression.</li>
				<li>Data delivery and clarity: The designer clearly had “hidden” some features of the data. The message of this visualization, I presume, is to showcase the waves of COVID-19 pandemics by the dynamics of incidence rate. While the spiral form may successfully communicate a sense of cyclical recurrence and temporal progression, it sacrifices clarity for aesthetic and metaphorical effect. Important numerical information—such as exact case counts, relative peak severity, and rate of decline—is not immediately legible. I must spend additional cognitive effort to decode the scale and orientation before extracting substantive insights. In this sense, the data are not entirely invisible, but they are partially obscured by design choices that prioritize narrative and visual impact over straightforward readability. This prioritization, however, is not necessarily a negative feature, instead, it does improve the delivery. The trend that COVID-19 cases in the United States occurred in recurring waves across 2020, 2021, and 2022 is visually clear. The spiral structure reinforces the cyclical passage of time, and the expanding radius effectively communicates the increasing magnitude of successive surges. Even without carefully reading the numeric scale, I could grasp that later waves, particularly in 2021 and early 2022, were substantially larger than those in 2020.</li>
				<li>Labeling, spacing, and design styling: Overall, the spacing and layout are thoughtfully constructed. The spiral composition creates a strong visual flow, guiding the eye naturally from 2020 at the center outward to 2022. There is sufficient white space around the spiral to prevent crowding, and the radial month markers are lightly styled so they do not compete with the primary data. The color choice helps subtly signaling urgency or danger (red). Although we have had debates in labs and lectures about how color choices could modify the audiences’ focus and interpretation, in this case I think the design language is relatively restrictive (as opposed to the Iraq war visualization oversaturated, vibrant blood-colored red we’ve seen in reading group), which indicates that the designers are trying to maintain a sense of neutrality in their delivery.</li>
			</ul>

				Design Critique:
				<p>
				I realized that my main concern with the original spiral graph was not its message, but its perceptual efficiency. While I appreciate the expressive power of the vortex-like form and how it captures the emotional experience of recurring waves, I found that it makes precise comparison unnecessarily difficult. Encoding magnitude through radial distance and band width forces me to judge values along curved paths without a shared baseline. I have to mentally rotate the graphic and estimate widths at angles, which increases cognitive load. As a result, it becomes harder to compare peak heights across years or to assess how sharply cases rose and fell. For a dataset where magnitude and timing are central, I felt that position along a common linear axis would communicate more clearly than area or radial length.
				</p>

				<p>
				I was also concerned about how the spiral’s composition subtly directs attention. The visual density accumulates in certain quadrants, which unintentionally amplifies particular surges simply because of how the spiral expands.

			<h2>Visualization Sketches</h2>

		</figure>

		<p>
			Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
		</p>

		<ul>
		<li>
			Replaced the spiral with a single linear vertical axis so magnitude is encoded by position to improve peception accuracy and reducing the amount of effort needed to grasp the key info.
		</li>
		<li>
			Using symmetrical design, I tried to normalize the effect of angular distribution on data interpretation so that the comparison between years can be made by looking at the horizontal spread while keeping the vertical line fixed. 
		</li>
		<li>
			Simplified the visual structure and remove radial distortion.
		</li>
		</ul>

		</figure>

		<p>
			Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
		</p>

		<ul>
		<li>
			The key feature of this redesign is that I paralleled each year into its own horizontal panel so that the resolution within one year could be higher (although due to the hand-drawing, the preciseness is compromised)
		</li>
		<li>
			I kept the vertical axis consistent across panels so magnitude is encoded by position on a shared scale, allowing peak heights and overall intensity to be compared directly.
		</li>
		<li>
			While keeping the waves and the original data in the graph, I also added a dotted line in the 2022 sub-graph such that the projected counts can also be extended into the graphs.
		</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
		</p>

		<ul>
		<li>
			In this redesign, I shifted from incidence to cumulative cases to emphasize long-term trend and growth. The reason for this change is that the previous designs did not provide a big picture presentation of the pandemic. So in this design, I want to take a birdseye view and observe what the overall trend of the pandemic looked like. For the sake of data accuracy, I did consult external sources for the ball park values at significant timepoints.
		</li>
		<li>
			I chose to use line plot so that the sense of temporal continuity from the original visualization is preserved. In addition, I feel like line chart is more direct in data delivery because the only channel is magnitude(y-axis height), which is a 1-dimensional metric, as opposed to area in my previous redesigns and the original graph.
		</li>
		<li>
			I chose to use slope as the primary visual mark so changes in growth rate become very intuitive.
		</li>
		</ul>

			<h2>Final Writeup</h2>

		<p>
			My final design aims to most effectively communicate the cyclical recurrence and relative intensity of COVID-19 waves across 2020, 2021, and 2022, while giving the audience greater quantitative resolution. The central message I seek to convey is that although the pandemic unfolded in repeated seasonal-like waves, the magnitude and acceleration of those waves varied substantially across years. Reflecting on the original graph, I appreciated the radial structure and wanted to preserve its circular encoding of time. Therefore, I implemented a circular histogram in which angle encodes day-of-year (temporal progression) and radial height encodes the 7-day average of new confirmed cases. Rather than relying on a line-area combination to represent incidence rates—where width or area can reduce perceptual precision—I shifted to a one-dimensional magnitude encoding. Inspired by lecture examples that combined radial layouts with more analytically precise marks, I integrated histogram bars into a circular framework. I chose bars because they anchor each observation to a shared baseline (the center), strengthening magnitude comparison relative to area-based encodings. Overlaying the three years enables direct comparison at identical time points, reinforcing the cyclical narrative while restoring perceptual accuracy through position along a radial axis. In terms of aesthetic factors, I picked distinct yet restrained blue, orange, and red hues differentiate the three years without overwhelming the composition. I made the radial gridlines relatively subtle and evenly spaced month labels support orientation and scale interpretation.
		</p>

		<p>
However, the decision to overlay all three years within a shared circular space inevitably introduces visual density, particularly during major surges when the bars from different years cluster in similar angular regions. At peak periods such as winter waves the overlapping colors and stacked radial heights can make it harder to isolate exact magnitudes without careful inspection. Although the shared circular framework strengthens the perception of cyclical recurrence and allows viewers to compare the same timepoints across years, it does not provide the same degree of numerical precision as a linear faceted time-series plot with aligned vertical baselines. In that sense, some fine-grained comparisons, like identifying which year’s peak was marginally higher or quantifying small differences in slopes, is slightly obscured by the radial geometry.		</p>
